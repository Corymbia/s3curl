s3curl for Eucalyptus
---------------------

s3curl is little nifty utility that we internally use to connect to
walrus. This is where you can download it and find more about it

	http://aws.amazon.com/code/128

It seems that there is no maintainer right now, nor patches are accepted,
so for convenience we provide here a zip file of the donwload and a patch
we need to change the URL endpoint. Once you applied the patch, you may
call the utility with the --url option. For example to talk to a walrus
sitting at 173.205.188.130

	--url  173.205.188.130

or (and this is perhaps simpler) you may specify an extra parameter (url)
in the .s3curl, where you specify 'id' and 'key', for example

	url => '173.205.188.130',

You will need to specify the full service path in the command line (for
example http://173.205.188.130:8773/services/Walrus which is conveniently
stored in the S3_URL enviromental variable).

s3curl is used with some of our script to interact with a specified walrus
(for example to save or restore configuration files or backups).
